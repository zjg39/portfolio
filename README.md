# Updated Portfolio
## Mobile-responsive portfolio of early work


### This portfolio contains five projects, all of which were made during my time in the Full Stack Web Development BootCamp at Georgia Tech.  Each project title is linked to the corresponding GitHub repository.  At the bottom, you'll find links that direct you to my LinkedIn profile, to my GitHub page, and a one that you can email me with.
